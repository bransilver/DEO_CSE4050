				<p>The history of pasta can very from historian to historian.
					Some may suggest that the pasta comes from the time of the 
					Talmud in the 5th century. Others may believe it originated
					in China where Marco Polo brought back the knowledge of it to 
					Venice. Either way, pasta is a versatile base that can be dressed
					up in many different ways.

				<h2>Spaghetti</h2>

				<p>
					Spaghetti is a form of pasta cut and shaped a certain way. 
					This pasta can be accompanied by various sauces such as marina, alfredo, or carbonara sauce. 
					Marina sauce is a tomato base sauce, spiced with fragrant herbs.
					Alfredo is a silkier, creamy sauce that works well with any addition. 
					Carbonara is an exquisite sauce as it has a balance of being creamy, rich, and salty
					So go out there and explore all the different sauces of the world.
					Or not if you are unable to eat gluten or just have a hard time finding
					a good gluten-free pasta. May pasta be the savior of your life of 
					harbringer of demise. To which pasta will decide your fate.

					The recipe to make pasta dough is quite simple and requires only 
					4 ingredients. These ingredients are flour, eggs, salt, and olive oil.
					If you do go out your way to make pasta from scratch, you might as well
					purchase the finest of ingredients. By combining parts of flour to eggs
					to salt to olive oil and kneading it until combined. Once formed and rested
					for 30 minutes, you can roll out your dough and use a pasta machine or cut it 
					by hand. I prefer to cut the dough by hand, and to do so, we must roll the dough
					thin enough and fold over and cut strips. However, if you want a specific shape,
					such as spagetti, you may need the assistance of a machine or the internet
					to learn how to cut this pasta into the exact shape.
